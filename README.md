HEY EVERY !!! IT'S ME!!! YOUR FAVORITE [[Text Transformation Script]]!!

This is a Python script that takes any input string and "Spamton-ifies" it, converting normal text into the chaotic, glitchy, and sales-pitch-perfect dialogue of Spamton G. Spamton from Deltarune.

It uses NLP (via spaCy) to intelligently identify the most important parts of a sentence, then applies a series of chaotic transformations to make it sound authentic.

### [[Specil Features]]

*   **Intelligent Bracketing:** Uses a scoring system to find the most "important" words and phrases to wrap in `[[DOUBLE BRACKETS]]`.
*   **Hyperlink Blocked:** Automatically selects the highest-scoring candidate phrase to be replaced with the iconic `[[Hyperlink Blocked]]`.
*   **The Glitch Engine:** Randomly applies authentic speech patterns:
    *   Chaotic C4P1T4L1Z4T10N and l-lowercase words.
    *   L337$P34K conversion (`e` -> `3`, `s` -> `$`, etc.).
    *   S-Stuttering on random words.
    *   Inconsistent      spacing.
*   **Thematic Vocabulary:** Prioritizes Spamton's favorite words (`KROMER`, `DEALS`, `FREEDOM`) for special treatment.
*   **Configurable Chaos:** Easily tune the probabilities for glitches, repetitions, and more to get your desired level of chaos.
*   **Multi-language Support:** Leverages `deep-translator` to process input from other languages before converting it.
